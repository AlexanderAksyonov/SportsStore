# SportsStore
test project from the book by Andrew Freeman

It my first big lesson project. 
It ASP.NET MVC 4 project, in which I learned the basics of controllers, views, routing di containers and entity framework.

important folder:
SportsStore.Domain - It contains project describing the data model. It contains classes for receiving and recording data from / to the database.

SportsStore.WebUI - It contains a draft to work with the web part. Keeps controllers, presentation, point of entry into the program and other important things for a web application.

SportsStore.UnitTests - Tests. The first tests implemented, then threw.
